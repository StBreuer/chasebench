The chaseBench.zip file is a Java library containing the tools for parsing and
writing the common format. The .zip file contains a project that can be readily
imported into Eclipse, without any external dependencies. The 'scenario'
directory an sample scenario, consisting of a source and target schema, s-t
TGDs, target EGDs, and a query. The format of all of these files should be
self-explanatory. The 'examples' directory contains an example class that uses
the library to load the scenario and print its contents. The example is
annotated so as to provide a starting point for using the library.
